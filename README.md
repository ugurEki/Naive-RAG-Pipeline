# Naive-RAG-Pipeline

A simple but effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI and vector databases.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project takes plain text from a PDF file, extract the data from PDF to Markdown format, and then turns it into the vector embeddings using Vertex AI, stores them in a vector database (ChromaDB, Pinecone or FAISS), and uses Gemini to answer user questions based on that content.

It is a great starting point for learning how RAG systems work.
